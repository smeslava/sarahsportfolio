            I live in Cottage Grove, Oregon just south of Eugene, Oregon.  We moved here because frankly, we got the most house for the least money.  My husband and I live west of here and were renting when housing prices started to skyrocket.  Our landlords handed us a notice that we had 60 days to move out because they were planning on selling the house.  They asked if we were willing to buy it several times in the years prior but at those times, we just couldnâ€™t afford it.  When they decided to sell it, we decided we might be able to find something a little larger and so we started packing and looking.  We ended up buying a house in Cottage Grove.
