        <p>Welcome to my personal site!  My name is Sarah, and I am married with a three-year-old daughter.  I live in Cottage Grove,      Oregon.  I was born and raised in Long Beach, California and moved to Oregon in 2010 for a job.  
            I have worked in Quality Control in the food industry since I graduated from college in 2001.  I started in Technical Services and moved my way up to Senior Quality Manager, which was a regional position over 5 production facilities across the United States.  I went back to single plant management when our daughter turned one.  
            I just recently went back to school, and am taking some pre-requisite courses prior to starting with the University of Colorado, Boulder’s online master’s program in computer science.
